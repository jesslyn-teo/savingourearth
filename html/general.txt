About The Creator 

Introduction: 
Hi! My name is Jesslyn Teo. I am a freshman at Singapore Polytechnic studying 
the course Information Technology. This website spreads awareness of our 
environment, statistics and data on how our actions harmed the environment, 
what to do next for a clean and green Singapore, and the Singapore 
Polytechnics' contributions to our society. 

Values:
Benevolence; As someone who wants the best for everyone, I enjoy
spreading happiness to my friends and family. I strongly believe in
showing goodwill to those around us or even strangers for the betterment
of our society.
Self-direction; With deep-seated compassion to learn, I would always want to 
polish my interpersonal and technical skills. By putting myself in
uncomfortable situations, I would strive to do my best in everything and
adapt to what is best for me.

Interest:
I enjoy bringing people together through various activities such as group
work, events and even bonding sessions. I also like going on
different adventures with my friends!
I also enjoy spending my free time at different nature parks in Singapore, 
including Jurong Lake Gardens and Botanic Gardens. Being able to stroll 
along the beautiful greenery is relaxing and therapeutic.

Personality:
As an outgoing individual, I would take up any role or task and do my
utmost to complete it to the best of my abilities. I am also
exceptionally self-driven and motivating, despite facing challenges
during tasks. With an open mind and heart, I love learning and
understanding discoveries from different walks of life.

Opinions and Goals

Statistics and data (Recorded on 28/06/2023)

Waste:
Tons of scrap from households: 983,345,682
Tons of electronic waste: 24,461,473

Forests and deserts:
A hectare of forests cut down/burned: 13,683,731
Percentage of wild forests left: 27.3%

Oceans: 
Tons of seafood produced: 83,658,664
Percentage of coral reefs left: 44%

Air: 
Years of healthy lives lost from air pollution: 50,440,101
Deaths from air pollution: 4,354,202

The data above from The World Counts the statistics and data are already 
increasing by the time you read this information. The amount of waste most 
likely double by 2050. With an increasing amount of waste, it will possibly 
lead to land, water and air pollution that will harm our environment 
even more! Click here to find out what you can do to save our earth!

How can we do better?
I feel that it is essential that we take saving our earth alarmingly seriously
because it contributes to many different aspects of our lives, such as
climate change. We are reliant on the food and water Mother Nature has
to offer to us. We fail to realise that some of our daily activities
damage our planet due to a lack of knowledge, such as throwing away
leftovers. Thus, it is also why we should take the initiative to learn
and do more for our country.

Personal Goals that you too can do:
To start easy, I would reduce plastic waste. Recyclable bags and tote bags can
be easily stored in our regular bags when grocery shopping and bringing my 
container to hawker centres when taking out my food is not as difficult as 
it sounds!

Following that, I would like to start being a more responsible member of
society. I would also like to participate in community services to gain
experience and share my knowledge with others.

Lastly, I want to be more involved in reducing, reusing and
recycling. Likewise, the new emphasis on electronic recycle bins has
been increasing, and I would like to be a part of it. These recycling
bins would reduce a large portion of waste generated.

laboratory that allows students to learn more about Solid Waste Management.
